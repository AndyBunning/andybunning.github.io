<h1>Welcome to My Digital Space!</h1>

<p>I am Andrew Bunning, an IT Cloud Solution Architect based in Glasgow, Scotland. I bring many years of experience across various industries and a passion for leveraging cloud technologies to create scalable, secure, and efficient solutions. My work is dedicated to helping businesses navigate the cloud landscape and adopt strategies that drive success.</p>

<p>Outside of the office, you will often find me actively volunteering with my local Scout group, where I lead a Cub pack, assist with the Scout Troop, and have recently started a Squirrel Scout Drey. This rewarding work keeps me engaged with the community, bringing the same energy and commitment that I value in my professional life.</p>

<p>This webste is under development, but feel free to explore my site to learn more about my work, my insights, and the impact I strive to make in the world of cloud solutions and beyond.</p>
