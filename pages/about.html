<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an IT Cloud Solution Architect with a strong foundation in designing, implementing, and managing cloud solutions that drive business transformation. Based in Glasgow, Scotland, I have spent over 20 years working across diverse sectors, from finance and healthcare to Defence and Public Sector, developing custom cloud architectures that are both resilient and future-proof.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have specialised in multi-cloud strategies, security, migrations, and automation to help reduce the cost of IT solutions, consistently delivering results that align with business objectives. I focus primarily on Microsoft technologies with certifications across Microsoft Azure, Secruity Services and Solution Architecture and I am committed to staying at the forefront of cloud technology trends to bring innovative, cost-effective solutions to my clients and stakeholders.</p>

<p>My approach is collaborative and customer-centric. I believe that successful cloud adoption goes beyond technology â€” it is about understanding each the unique challenges that each organisation has and crafting solutions that scale with their growth. By leveraging a deep knowledge of cloud platforms and a passion for problem-solving, I aim to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and business goals.</p>

<p>Outside the professional sphere, I am deeply committed to my community. For over five years, I have been a dedicated volunteer with my local Scout group - leading a Cub pack, assisting with a Scout Troop, and recently establishing a new Squirrel Scout Drey. These roles have enhanced my leadership, communication, and mentoring skills, values I bring into my professional life.</p>
